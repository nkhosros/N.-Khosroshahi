- Analyzation/optimization of Forward Error Correction(FEC) coding method applied in inter-vehicle wireless communication systems.
- Suggestion of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) Codes with less complexity therefore less expenses as an FEC coding method with much better performance in compare with conventional Convolutional coding method in Dedicated Short Range Communication(DSRC) systems.
- Investigation of the Quasi-Cyclic LDPC codes' feasibility for DSRC systems via MATLAB programming and presenting it as a simpler, less expensive and even more efficient coding technique for DSRC systems which is considered as an Internet of Thing(IoT) in Intelligent Transportation Systems(ITS).
